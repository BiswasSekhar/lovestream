# 💝 Lovestream: One All-Nighter, One Vibe for Couples

Happy Valentine's Day! 🌹

While everyone was planning dates, I pulled an all-nighter to build something for them. 

Introducing **Lovestream** — a solo dev project built to help couples watch movies together, no matter the distance. 

### 🎬 The Vibe
It's simple: I wanted to create a shared theater experience that actually syncs up. No "3, 2, 1, press play" phone calls. Just you, your partner, and the movie.

### ✨ What's in the MVP?
*   **Synchronized Playback**: Real-time sync for play/pause/seek.
*   **P2P Streaming**: Direct transfer of MP4/MKV files (no cloud uploads).
*   **Video Chat**: Picture-in-picture mode to see their reactions.
*   **Privacy**: It's all peer-to-peer.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer: Fast Build!
This was a caffeine-fueled sprint to get it out for today. 
It's an **MVP**. There might be bugs. There might be dragons. 🐉
But it works, and it's open for anyone to try.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
*   React + Vite
*   Node.js + Socket.IO
*   WebRTC (simple-peer)
*   WebTorrent

### 🦄 "Doesn't this already exist?"
Yes! There are great tools out there like **Teleparty** (for streaming services) or **Syncplay** (desktop apps).
BUT... I wanted something that:
1.  Works in the browser (no installs for my partner).
2.  Plays **LOCAL** files (so we're not limited to what's on Netflix).
3.  Is completely private/P2P (no servers watching us).
Plus, sometimes you just want to build it yourself to say you did. 🛠️

### 🚀 Check it out
I've open-sourced it. Suggestions, bug fixes, and improvements are VERY welcome!

To the couples: Enjoy the movie night. 🍿
To the devs: Happy debugging! 💻
